# Alarm-clock
This is a simple alarm clock program written in Python. It allows you to set an alarm time and plays a sound when the alarm goes off.

## Features

- Set a specific alarm time in HH:MM:SS format.
- Plays a sound when the alarm time is reached.
- Uses the `datetime` and `time` modules for time-related operations.
- Uses the `winsound` module to play the alarm sound.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `winsound` module (built-in on Windows)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alarm-clock.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
bash
cd alarm-clock


3. Set the alarm time in the `alarm_time` variable inside the `alarm_clock.py` file:

   
python
alarm_time = "07:00:00"


4. Run the program:

   
bash
python alarm_clock.py


5. The program will continuously check the current time and play the alarm sound when the alarm time is reached.

## Customization

- You can change the alarm sound by replacing the "sound.wav" file with your desired sound file. Make sure to update the file path in the `alarm_clock.py` file.
